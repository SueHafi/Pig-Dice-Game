# Pig Dice Game

An implementation of the Pig Dice Game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It features a clean, responsive design with flex and grid.

Had a lot of fun implementing the colour themes and really enjoyed the rewards of being able to play something I created afterwards by challenging friends to a game.
