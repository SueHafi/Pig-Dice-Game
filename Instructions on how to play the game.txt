Instructions on how to play:
Player One is the starting player.

Rolling the dice:
Any roll of a number between 2-6 on the dice roll will
be added to the player's "current score". The player can
choose to either keep rolling or hold. If the
player keeps rolling their dice and they eventually 
roll a 1 they will lose their "current score". This will
end their turn and switch to the other player.

Pressing Hold:
If the player chooses to press "hold" at any point during
their turn they will bank their current score so far. It will
be added to their overall "player score" and end their
turn, switching to the other player.

Winning condition:
The first player to reach an overall "playerscore" of "100 
points" wins the game!
