player scores: hold total score
current score: only shows addition of current scores
you can hold without rolling any dice 
pressing hold adds on current score to existing player score
once you reach 100 points you win
I wanna set a "win screen" maybe with small piggies in background and a crowned pig emoji
once you have won you can not change 
I also want to set an instructions modal on the page where the game instructions pop up and are readable 
In future maybe I could add a tally of who won how many games 
dice image for rolling a number 1 die can be red with black dots or something so you know you rolled a different die 

make current player styles and find a way to discover current player. Always start with player 1.

handle roll dice - display dice number, handle each dice number being added correctly to current score

handle rolling a 1 -  when you roll a 1 you lose your current score (gets set to 0) and it switches to other player
pressing hold - adds current score to player score and switches player and sets current score to 0
handle win condition - player score reaches 100 - player wins, buttons "roll dice" "hold" don't work anymore, only new game button works, produce a win screen, get rid of dice image
new game - sets player scores and current scores to 0, dice disappears, set player 1 as starting player
